# X-ray diffraction Line Profile Analysis with deep Neural Networks (LPA-NN)

Jupyter notebooks to train and test a convolutional neural network devoted to the determination of crystallite size and/or microstrain from XRD data.

- Size: train and test
- Size_strain: train and evaluate a CNN with size and microstrain
- Spinel: a CNN to determine size and microstrain from a spinel phase formed by solid-state reaction between MgO and Al2O3. Experimental data, recorded in situ at 1200Â°C at the BM01 beamline (ESRF).
